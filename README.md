Bis
===

Bis is a file compression tool written in C. It compresses files using
a combination of the Burrows-Wheeler transform and Huffman coding.
It is probably not useful for practical purposes, as there are compression
methods out there that are both faster and more effective. Hopefully,
someone will at least have fun reading the code.
